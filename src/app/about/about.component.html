    <h2>HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS PROVIDE THE BEST RESULTS</h2>
    <p>Our products are sourced directly from the manufacturers allowing us to control every
      variable that might affect their quality. Shipped from one side of the globe to the other,
      the shiny supplement tubs you see on shelves might not have made it to Lebanon in the best
      conditions...Most local dealers ship their orders the cheapest possible way in regular
      containers ignoring the fact that high humidity and high temperatures dramatically
      damage supplements lowering there potency and efficiency.
      However you can rest assured that at Shape Up we commit to high quality at any cost,
      we import all our orders either by plane or in refrigerated containers allowing
      us to guaranty the quality of the supplements we sell.</p>
    <h2>HOW DO WE OFFER BETTER QUALITY AT A BETTER PRICE?</h2>
    <h4>The longer the chain the higher the price and the lower the quality!</h4>
    <p>
      Once the products reach our warehouse we take the necessary measures to provide the best storage conditions. Our warehouse is equipped
      with air conditioners and dehumidifiers keeping the temperature between 15 and 25 degree
      Celsius(Â°C) and the humidity between 40 and 60 percent throughout the 4 seasons.
